c Two different "stacks" of memory will be available in the course of an
c Aces3 calculation.  Integer memory will be stored in icore.  Real memory
c will be stored in dcore.
c
c Memory allocation is done in one of two ways, dynamic or nondynamic.  This
c is controlled by the parameter dynmem.  If dynmem is 1, dynamic memory
c is used.  Otherwise, nondynamic memory is used.
c
c Two additional parameters nondynimem and nondyndmem control how much
c nondynamic memory is allocated initially in the icore and dcore stacks.
c If dynmem is 1, both of these parameters SHOULD be 1.

c Dynamic memory allocation is done in a fairly straighforward way.  The
c program runs through everything twice.  The first time is just to determine
c how much dynamic memory is required.  The second time is use to actually
c allocate the memory and use it.  In some cases, it may be difficult to
c determine how much memory to use in advance in each of the stacks.  To
c aid this, there is also the option of only running through a program a
c single time.  When this happens, both stacks are allocated initially and
c used throughout the program.  If the memory requirement for either stack
c is exceeded, the program crashes.
c
c Two parameters which are used in either case are memknown and maxicore.
c Both MUST be set in the calling program.
c
c   memknown : 0 if a dummy run is being done to determine memory usage
c              1 if the memory usage is known from a previous dummy run
c             -1 if no dummy run is done (only one run through the program)
c   maxicore : the maximum amount of icore to allocate (this MAY be
c              adjusted IF a dummy run detects that more is needed, but in
c              the case of a single run, this will be rigidly applied)
c
c This include file is required whenever calls to any of the memory functions
c (setptr and relptr) are called or when part of the execution depends on
c whether the first or second run is being performed.
c
c ***NOTE***
c It is important that icore be aligned on a floating point boundary.  One
c way which seems to insure this is to have icore the FIRST element in the
c common block.  So, make sure that no integer is ever inserted before icore
c in the common block declaration.

c This common block contains the molecule and basis set information
c read in from the JOBARC file.  Since much of this information is
c used in a large number of modules, and since most of the information
c is relatively small compared to the other things held in memory,
c a large percentage of the data stored in the JOBARC file is stored
c here, even though some modules will not use all of it.

c   maxangshell - The maximum number of angular momentum shells.  Since this
c                 is used VERY infrequently, set it high enough to never
c                 cause a problem.
c   spinc(2)    - The characters 'A' and 'B' (useful for alpha/beta labels)
c   natoms      - The number of atoms in the Z-matrix (including X/GH).  After
c                 remove is called, natoms becomes equivalent to nrealatm.
c   natomsx     - The number of atoms in the Z-matrix (including X/GH).  This
c                 does not change.
c   nrealatm    - The number of atoms in the Z-matrix (including GH).
c   naobasfn    - The number of AOs in the basis
c   nbastot     - The number of symmetry adapted orbitals in the basis (the AO
c                 basis may be larger than the SO basis if spherical orbitals
c                 are used since harmonic contaminants are deleted)
c   linear      - 1 if the molecule is linear
c   orientmt    - 3x3 matrix which relates the computational and canonical
c                 orientations
c   nucrep      - Nuclear repulsion energy in a.u.
c   nmproton    - Number of protons in the molecule.
c
c   compptgp    - Point group
c   fullptgp    -
c   compordr    - Order of the point group
c   fullordr    -
c   compnirr    - Number of irreps in the point group
c   fullnirr    -
c   compnorb    - Number of unique atoms (orbits) in the point group
c   fullnorb    -
c   c1symmet    - 1 if the molecule is C1 symmetry
c   nirrep      - The same as compnirr (since nirrep is used so commonly,
c                 this is included for conveniance)
c                 ***NOTE*** nirrep is read in twice and is stored in /sym/
c                            so it is not actually included here
c   totprim     - Total number of primitive functions in the molecule
c   maxshlprim  - Largest number of primitives in a single shell
c   maxshlao    - Largest number of AOs in a single shell
c   maxshlorb   - Largest number of primitive orbitals (primitive functions
c                 times the number of AOs) in a single shell
c   maxangmom   - Largest angular momentum for any atom
c   maxshell    - Larges number of angular momentum shells for any atom
c   noccorb(2)  - The number of alpha and beta occupied orbitals
c   nvrtorb(2)  - The number of alpha and beta virtual orbitals

c The parameter maxorbit is needed because of how dynamic memory is used.
c Two runs of the program are needed.  The first to calculate memory usage,
c the second to use it.  In order to calculate totprim, we have to know the
c orbit population vector (the number of each type of atom).  BUT, this is
c stored in dynamic memory since we do not know how long this vector is.
c In the future, joda or vmol will write this information to JOBARC, and
c this problem will disappear.  In the meantime, we have to introduce a
c genuine limit on the size of the molecule.  It may have no more than
c maxorbit sets of unique atoms.  This limit is ONLY used in the subroutine
c basis, so it probably will disappear when the information in the MOL file
c is put in JOBARC.
c    maxorbit   - the number of symmetry unique atoms

c The following are pointers to real arrays
c
c   zatommass(natoms)  - Atomic mass of all atoms (X=0.0, GH=100.0)
c   zcoord(3,natoms)   - Coordinates of all atoms (computational orientation)
c   zalpha(totprim)    - The alpha for each primitive function
c   zprimcoef(totprim,naobasfn)
c                      - The primitive to AO coefficients

c   pfullmemb(natoms)  - Atoms sorted by point group orbits
c   pcompmemb(natoms)  -
c   pnprimatom(natoms) - Number of primitive functions for each atom
c   pnshellatom(natoms)- Number of different angular momentum shells for each
c                        atom (takes on values of 1,4,9,16, etc.)
c   pnangatom(natoms)  - The number of different angular momentum for each
c                        atom (takes on values of 1,2,3,4, etc.)
c   pnaoatom(natoms)   - Number of AOs for each atom
c   pnshellprim(maxshell,natoms)
c                      - The number of primitive functions in each shell
c                        of each atom
c   pnshellao(maxshell,natoms)
c                      - The number of AOs in each shell of each atom
c   pprimoff(maxshell,natoms)
c   paooff(maxshell,natoms)
c                      - The primcoef matrix is a block diagonal matrix.
c                        Each shell of each atom has a block.  If you have
c                        a list of all primitive functions, pprimoff(ishell,
c                        iatom) tells the location of the first primitive
c                        function in the block (ishell,iatom) and paooff
c                        contains similar information for the AOs.
c
c ***NOTE***  Because joda stores pfullpopv/pcomppopv as size natoms, we
c             do to, but they should be of size fullnorb/compnorb.  The
c             first ones have real values.  The remaining ones are 0.
